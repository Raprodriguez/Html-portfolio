<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there future employer!</p>

<p>My name is Raphael Lorenz A. Rodriguez, I am a graduate of bachelors of Science in Business Economics at Xavier<br>
University Ateneo De Cagayan in the beautiful islands of the Philippines. I also hold a diploma in Professional Cooking<br>
at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology in Calgary Alberta. </p>

<p>I have been a chef for almost 9 years, and I am planning on changing careers since I feel like being in the culinary industry<br> 
  feels like a dead-end job. I have been really into technology and is always amazed on how everything works. While searching for<br> 
  what I want in life, I decided to look for something that is on tech industry, and I discovered web develpoment. After taking<br>
  the course for a few hours I found in Udemy, I fell inlove. It's like theres a fire in me that sparked.I love this and will do my <br>
  best to pursue this dream of becoming a full pledged master in web development.
